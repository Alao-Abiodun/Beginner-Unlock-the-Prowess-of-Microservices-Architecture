# Explaining Design Pattern Using Code Examples

## Single Responiblity Principle 

- Single Responsbility Principle simply means a module or function or class should only be responsible for just one problem and not use for multiple problems.

## Open-Closed Principle 

- Open Close Principle simply means that a class should open for extension but close for extension which means that a particular should be able to apply for other module but you can change that file that you are extending which means you can modify it because it's been used in other files or modules.

## Liskov Substitution Principle 

- Liskov Substitution Essentially means that a base class should be able to substitute for parent class methods without having breaking changes in the parent class methods.

## Interface Segregation Principle 

- Interface Segregation Principle means that a client should only apply for methods that is required to be implemented and not pushed to implement modules that is not required.

## Dependencies Inversion Principle 

- Dependencies Inversion Principle means that both high level and low level modules should be independent of each other which means that means they should depend on each other rather than to depends on an abstract module or interface module.
