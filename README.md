# Explaining Design Pattern Using Code Examples

## Single Responiblity Principle 

- Single Responsbility Principle simply means a module or function or class should only be responsible for just one problem and not use for multiple problems.

## Open-Closed Principle 

- Open Close Principle simply means that a class should open for extension but close for extension which means that a particular should be able to apply for other module but you can change that file that you are extending which means you can modify it because it's been used in other files or modules.
